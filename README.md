# Time-Series-Forecasting-on-Electricity-Consumption-Data-for-A-Commercial-Building 

This is a repository for the codes we have tried out in handling missing entries and making predictions for the time series electricity dataset. We eventually used BRITs for missing entries imputation and LSTM-ResNet for time series forecasting.
